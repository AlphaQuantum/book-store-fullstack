# Book Store Fullstack
This project has been developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. 
## Front-End Tech
On the front-end, I have utilized 
+ React Js
+ React Router Dom
+ Axios Js
## Back-End Tech
On the back-end, I have used
+ Node Js (Express Js)
+ MySQL
>During development i also used Postman to test the API
## Getting Started
1. Open a new terminal
2. type `cd backend` and `npm start`
3. go back `cd ../client` and type `npm start`
4. The database depends on you, it's a simple MySQL db
> + Create a Schema called book_db (or call it what you want and change it later)
> + Add 5 columns called `id` `title` `desc` `cover` `price`
## Future
- [ ] Use a CSS framework (probably tailwind)
- [ ] Add authentication
